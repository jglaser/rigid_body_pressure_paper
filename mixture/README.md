# Data for Fig. 2

The subdirectories `md/` and `mc/` contain the simulation scripts to generate
data for Fig. 2, using the MD and the HPMC component of [HOOMD-blue](http://github.com/glotzerlab/hoomd-blue).
Data space and workflow management requires [signac](http://github.com/glotzerlab/signac) and
[signac-flow](http://github.com/glotzerlab/signac-flow).
